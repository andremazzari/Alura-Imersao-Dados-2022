# Download data

The function DownloadAllData() in make_dataset.py creates the folder '/data/' and its subfolders, as used in the notebooks.
<br><br>
It also downloads the database of house prices in SÃ£o Paulo and the database of IBGE data.
<br><br>
The two other databases, needed to merge the house prices data with IBGE data, must be downloaded manually from the links below.
<br><br>
The database of house addresses, that connect the addresses with longitude and latitude, must be saved in '/data/external'. The databases (4 files) used by geopandas must be saved in '/data/external/Data_Geopandas'.
